- Fixed issue with NUI being inaccessible with empty garage/impound table.
- Fixed issue with TextUI keybinding to park vehicle.
- Fixed issue when player could access garage/impound through target while being inside of the vehicle.
- Fixed issue with applying mods for color where resource expected it to be a number.

- Added compatibilities for TextUI.
- Added `Config.Navbars` object to disable/enable navbars (fuel, repair, etc.).
- Added export `RefreshVehiclesList` that can be called through server side to refresh ZSX Garages vehicle object list. *(useful for vehicles that are inserted to the database but not exactly spawned on the player)*
