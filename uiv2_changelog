- Created function to automatically centerized hud elements when position is not set.

- Added missing translation for "Weapon" in weapon indicator.
- Added param `Config.BringPlayerAfterWelcomeScreenToInitialCoords` that can bring players to initial coordinates after welcome screen ends. Useful for people that doesn't use any multicharacters at all.

- Fixed issue with weapon indicator overlapping with carhud, now we gather offsets of carhud and move it on top of it. Still if carhud will be more to the left it can look a bit weird.
- Fixed issue with progressbar intervals for disable controls, now the interval is lower.
- Fixed issue with gathering presets using `/get_config_preset <interface>`.
- Fixed issue with seatbelt indicator sound could play twice.
- Fixed issue with NUI transition between Pause Menu -> UI Settings.

- Removal of additional outputs from NUI.
